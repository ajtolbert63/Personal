Kristen,

I was going to get you a card that wished you luck, but that didn’t seem right. You don’t need luck. You have the skill and certainly the determination to be successful in whatever you do. 

I just hope you take care of yourself. Remember, polo is fun. 

Text/call anytime.

Go stupid
Go nuts
